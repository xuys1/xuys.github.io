I am a second-year graduate student from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [Shanghaitech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Quan Li](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/), and I also obtained a B.S. degree from the same university. My research focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI) and data visualization (VIS). My recent research focuses on exploring their applications in medical education.
